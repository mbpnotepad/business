# Interest

Interest is the amount of money a lender or financial institution receives for
lending out money. Interest can also refer to the amount of ownership a
stockholder has in a company, usually expressed as a percentage.

## Simple Interest

Simple interest is a set rate on the principal originally lent to the borrower
that the borrower has to pay for the ability to use the money.

## Compound Interest

Compound interest is interest on both the principal and the compounding interest
paid on that loan.

FV = P(1 + r)^t

How much do I need to put aside today to have {{<katex>}}C_t{{</katex>}},
{{<katex>}}t{{</katex>}} years from now?

PV = \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}

You are taking {{<katex>}}C_t{{</katex>}} and discounting back to the present.

## Special Considerations

A low-interest-rate environment is intended to stimulate economic growth so that
it is cheaper to borrow money. This is beneficial for those who are shopping for
new homes, simply because it lowers their monthly payment and means cheaper
costs. When the Federal Reserve lowers rates, it means more money in consumers'
pockets, to spend in other areas, and more large purchases of items, such as
houses. Banks also benefit from this environment because they can lend more
money.

However, low-interest rates aren't always ideal. A high-interest rate typically
tells us that the economy is strong and doing well. In a low-interest-rate
environment, there are lower returns on investments and in savings accounts, and
of course, an increase in debt which could mean more of a chance of default when
rates go back up.
