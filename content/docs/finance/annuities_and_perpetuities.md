## Annuity

An annuity is an equal and annual series of payments made over a predetermined
time period. Annuities can be used for a variety of purposes, but the most
common one is providing a steady income for retirees.

In the case of retirees, a lump sum of money or assets is exchanged for a series
of smaller payments in the future. This payment is often guaranteed for the life
of the beneficiary, meaning that, for a fee, the seller of an annuity assumes
the longevity risk, or the risk that the beneficiary will outlive the amount
paid.
